# Becoming Rustaceans

### Motivation
>  Rust isn't difficult, it's unfamiliar  
> \- [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs)    
  
Is the quote that immediately hooks me up to learn Rust after a quick glance at its properties. Though many perceive Rust as the hardest thing to learn, at that moment I decided myself to master it.  

> In other languanges simple things are easy and complex things are possible,

Compared to learning other languanges, it is harder to get into Rust with many of its unfamiliar properties. But it would also mean that Rust upfronts and makes you deal with all of the work that you ultimately need later in development so you would not spiral out as your project grows in complexity.       

### What I like
Rust is a hybrid imperative langunge combined with functional programming. Though we can write it by how we used to in Java, Python or any other languanges, it is eye opening to adopt its functional principle like those exist in Haskell which is relatively harder to get into.  

I'am also deeply amazed how smart the compiler is. It is literally your best friend, only if you're also being a `best friend` to it.
