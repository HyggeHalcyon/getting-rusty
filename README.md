# Becoming Rustaceans

### Motivation
Is the quote that immediately hooks me up to learn Rust after a quick glance at its properties. Though many perceive Rust as the hardest thing to learn, at that moment I decided determine myself to master it.  

It is harder to get into Rust with many of its unfamiliar properties unlike other languanges, but it would also mean that Rust upfronts and makes you deal with all of the work that you will also need later in development so you would not spiral out as your Project grows on complexity.

### What I like
Rust is a hybrid imperative langunge combined with functional programming. Though we can write it by how we used to in Java, Python or other languanges, it is eye opening to adopt its functional principle like those exist  Haskell which is relatively harder to get into.  

I'am also deeply amazed how smart the compiler is, it is literally your best friend. Only if you're also being a 'best friend' to it.     

// TODO: add why u like the borrow checker and the overall method of writing safe code if terms of pointer and memory access
